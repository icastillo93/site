## A New post
    The next game that I am going to talk about is [FLEXBOX FROGGY](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) it is a game that where you have to get the the frog to the lilly pad by putting in code to tell the frog what to do. I don't know much about this game but it is one of the easiest games to play.****
    
    The next game is [code combat](https://codecombat.com/play) which is one of my favorite because it is easy to play and understand. The objective is to complete the different levels to proceed through the game. You can chose from 4 different code styles the two that i use are Python and Javascript.
    
    
	The last and final game that i'm going to be talking about is CSS dinner. There is 26 levels to play and you will get the hang of it fast there's not much to explain about this game. 
    
    So if want to play any of these game then click on the link that I have left for each one of the games.
