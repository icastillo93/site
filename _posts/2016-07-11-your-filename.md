## A New Post

	Have you ever wanted to learn CSS or JS? Well now you can I will list some games that I have found helpful to me. I will give a brief description of each game and leave the link too.

	For the first one here is the [link](http://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/) the game is about going through the code and finding out how to get out of the the box that you are in. The objtive of the game is to use the code and get out of the box and collect the blue rectangle by useing the arrow keys to move around.
