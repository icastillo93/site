Want to make your own Site? Well now you can. Just read this blog and follow the steps in this post.

The first thing you need to do is make a [github](https://github.com/) account. After you do that you can fork my site to help you make your own site. I will leave a link to my site so you can fork it. [My site](https://github.com/icastillo93/site)

Then you can go to prose.io and login there to edit your site there and look at the code of your site. Here is the link for [prose](http://prose.io/) Github builds your site from the 'gh-pages' branch so make sure you are on that branch inside prose.io.

To see your site go to this link [here](https://yourgithubusername.github.io/site/) but replace yourgithubusername with your github username. If you want to hide the posts that are already on the site, go into prose.io and click the button that says publish then save the site. To create a new post using prose.io, click on _posts and then click 'New File.'

If you want to look at how the site works here is an exmaple of what the code looks like in my site.

Github uses jekyll. Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. 

Here are [more examples](https://icastillo93.github.io/site/examples/) of how to put content on a web pages.

You can edit any files in your github project without useing prose.io.
